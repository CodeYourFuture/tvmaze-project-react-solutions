# What's this?

This is a set of solutions _in React_ to the various levels of the [tv-show-dom-project](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/syllabus/tree/master/js-core-3/tv-show-dom-project) challenge.

Each level is in its own **branch** in this repo, but is also deployed separately to netlify. (Right now, you're probably looking at the master branch.)

## General Notes

### No React idioms in early levels:

Earlier levels are intentionally written _without_ the use of common React idioms.

This is in order that they look as familiar as possible for CYF students meeting React for the first time.

Just because you see something done one way here doesn't mean that's the best or most common way to do it.

Examples:

- no destructuring of objects (e.g. to extract from props)
- no file-per-component breakdown - see the (invented) level-101 solution for this refactoring.

### Minimal viable solution, always:

Also, at each level, the bare minimum has been done to meet the requirements. There is no finessing.

This is to limit the amount of code students have to read through to grasp what's going on.

### The CSS is bad:

The CSS is bad.

# Original docs generated by create-react-app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
